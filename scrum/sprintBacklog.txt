# Copy User Stories from the ProductBacklog 
# to the appropriate Sprint below, after the 
# Sprint Planning Meeting.

# Sprint 1 October 6, 2016:
User stories to-do list:
	 - See GUI 
	 - Move Moves
	 - See number of moves
	 - See State of Jugs 
  See GUI user story is the most important, it is the basic framework where all the other user stories add onto it. 
  The next part that logically makes sense is making a move, this user story doesn't want to visually see his result, 
  they just want to be able to play the game. The see number of moves and see state of jug user stories go hand in hand. 
  When a move is made, the state of the jugs should either change or be unchanged depending on what buttons were pressed. 
  
# Sprint 2 October 9, 2016

User stories to-do list:
	- New Game Any Time
	- Quit Any Time
	- New Game when Won
	** - High score. ( Product Owner expectation )
Completed user stories:
	- See GUI 
	- Move Moves
	- See number of moves
	- See State of Jugs 
	- Won Halts Game
	- Won alert
  Since the programmers/team were able to meet all of the expected user stories on time and even complete some extra user stories 
  in their spare time, it's time to move things ahead for the next sprint. By the next sprint the rest of the user stories should be 
  completed. The final sprint will be used to add any extra features that the Product Owner decides to add.
  
# Sprint 3 October 12, 2016
  Within the span of October 9 to October 12, the remaining three tasks have been completed:
    - New Game Any Time
	- Quit Any Time
	- New Game when Won
  
  Incredible job done by the team completing the assignment ahead of time, project owner decided to omit the high score feature
  since it wasn't necessary, he's satisfied with the outcome. As project scrum leader, I hereby announce the team free and the
  job completed.
